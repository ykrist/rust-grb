Determines which child node is explored first in the branch-and-cut search. The default value chooses automatically. A
value of -1 will always explore the down branch first, while a value of 1 will always explore the up branch first.

Changing the value of this parameter rarely produces a significant benefit.

Note: Only affects mixed integer programming (MIP) models
