Indicates whether the Remote Services cluster is using insecure mode in the TLS (Transport Layer Security). Set this to
0 unless your server administrator tells you otherwise.

Refer to the Gurobi Remote Services Reference Manual for more information on starting Compute Server jobs.

You must set this parameter through either a gurobi.lic file (using CSTLSINSECURE) or an empty environment. Changing the
parameter after your environment has been created will have no effect.
