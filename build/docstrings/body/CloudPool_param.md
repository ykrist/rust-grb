Set this parameter to the name of the cloud pool you would like to use for your new Instant Cloud instance. You can
browse your existing cloud pools or create new ones from your account on the Gurobi Instant Cloud Manager website.

You must set this parameter through either a gurobi.lic file (using CLOUDPOOL=pool) or an empty environment. Changing
the parameter after your environment has been created will have no effect.
