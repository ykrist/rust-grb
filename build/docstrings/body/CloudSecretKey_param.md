Set this parameter to the Secret Key for your Instant Cloud license when launching a new instance. You can retrieve this
string from your account on the Gurobi Instant Cloud Manager website.

You must set this parameter through either a gurobi.lic file (using CLOUDSECRETKEY=key) or an empty environment.
Changing the parameter after your environment has been created will have no effect.
