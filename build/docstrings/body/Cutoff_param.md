Indicates that you aren't interested in solutions whose objective values are worse than the specified value. If the
objective value for the optimal solution is equal to or better than the specified cutoff, the solver will return the
optimal solution. Otherwise, it will terminate with a CUTOFF status (see the Status Code section for further details).
