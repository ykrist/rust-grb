Index of variable with the largest (unscaled) reduced cost violation. Note that the result may be larger than the number
of variables in the model, which indicates that a constraint slack is the variable with the largest violation. Subtract
the variable count from the result to get the index of the corresponding constraint.

Only available for continuous models.
