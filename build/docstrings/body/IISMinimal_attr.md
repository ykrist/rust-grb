Indicates whether the current Irreducible Inconsistent Subsystem (IIS) is minimal. This attribute is only available
after you have computed an IIS on an infeasible model. It will normally take value 1, but it may take value 0 if the IIS
computation was stopped early (e.g., due to a time limit or user interrupt).
