Indicates whether the model is a MIP. Note that any discrete elements make the model a MIP. Discrete elements include
binary, integer, semi-continuous, semi-integer variables, SOS constraints, and general constraints. In addition, models
having multiple objectives or multiple scenarios are considered as MIP models, even when all variables are continuous
and all constraints are linear.
