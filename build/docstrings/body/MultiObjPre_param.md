Controls the initial presolve level used for multi-objective models. Value 0 disables the initial presolve, value 1
applies presolve conservatively, and value 2 applies presolve aggressively. The default -1 value usually applies
presolve conservatively. Aggressive presolve may increase the chance of the objective values being slightly different
than those for other options.

Note: Only affects multi-objective models
