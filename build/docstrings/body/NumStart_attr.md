Number of MIP starts in the model. Decreasing this attribute will discard existing MIP starts. Increasing it will create
new MIP starts (initialized to undefined).

You can use the StartNumber parameter to query or modify start values for different MIP starts, or to append a new one.
The value of StartNumber should always be less than NumStart.
