When the model has multiple objectives, this attribute is used to query or modify the name for objective $n$. You set
$n$ using the ObjNumber parameter.

The number of objectives in the model can be queried (or modified) using the `NumObj` attribute.

Please refer to the discussion of Multiple Objectives for more information on the use of alternative objectives.
