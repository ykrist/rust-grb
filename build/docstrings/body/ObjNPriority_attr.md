This attribute is used to query or modify the priority of objective $n$ when doing hierarchical multi-objective
optimization. You set $n$ using the ObjNumber parameter.

The default priority for an objective is 0.

The number of objectives in the model can be queried (or modified) using the `NumObj` attribute.

Please refer to the discussion of Multiple Objectives for more information on the use of alternative objectives.
