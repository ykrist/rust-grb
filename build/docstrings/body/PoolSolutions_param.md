Determines how many MIP solutions are stored. For the default value of PoolSearchMode, these are just the solutions that
are found along the way in the process of exploring the MIP search tree. For other values of PoolSearchMode, this
parameter sets a target for how many solutions to find, so larger values will impact performance.

Note: Only affects mixed integer programming (MIP) models
