Controls the presolve dependent row reduction, which eliminates linearly dependent constraints from the constraint
matrix. The default setting (-1) applies the reduction to continuous models but not to MIP models. Setting 0 turns the
reduction off for all models. Setting 1 turns it on for all models.
