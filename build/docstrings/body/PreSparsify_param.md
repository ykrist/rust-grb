Controls the presolve sparsify reduction. This reduction can sometimes significantly reduce the number of non-zero
values in the presolved model. Value 0 shuts off the reduction, while value 1 forces it on. The default value of -1
chooses automatically.

Note: Only affects mixed integer programming (MIP) models
