When the model has multiple scenarios, this attribute is used to query the objective bound for scenario $n$. You set $n$
using the ScenarioNumber parameter.

The number of scenarios in the model can be queried (or modified) using the `NumScenarios` attribute.

Please refer to the Multiple Scenarios discussion for more information.
