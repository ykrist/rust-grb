The tuning tool often finds multiple parameter sets that produce better results than the baseline settings. This
parameter controls how many of these sets should be retained when tuning is complete. The default value retains the best
results that were found for each count of changed parameters. In other words, it retains the best result for one changed
parameter, for two changed parameter, etc. Results that aren't on the efficient frontier are discard.
