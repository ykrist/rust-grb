`Work` spent on the most recent optimization. In contrast to Runtime, work is deterministic, meaning that you will get
exactly the same result every time provided you solve the same model on the same hardware with the same parameter and
attribute settings. The units on this metric are arbitrary. One work unit corresponds very roughly to one second on a
single thread, but this greatly depends on the hardware on which Gurobi is running and the model that is being solved.
